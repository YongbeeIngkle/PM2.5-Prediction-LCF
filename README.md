# PM2.5-Prediction-LCF
Code, and Supplementary for the paper: _"Transfer across Space via Characteristic Feature: A Case Study for PM2.5 Prediction"_ submitted to Sigspatial2023

## Folders Description:
1. **transfer learning test:** Contains the train-test of SWA, LCF and original feature for transfer-learning.
  * The feature model is noted in the file names. (e.g. LCF.py, SWA only.py)
2. **map plot:** Contains the computation of prediction for plot on map.
  * The file with _predict in the name yields the prediction results.
  * prediction map plot.py plots using the prediction results.
3.
