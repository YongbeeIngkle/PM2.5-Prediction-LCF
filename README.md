2. **map plot:** Contains the computation of prediction for plot on map.
3. **encoder model test:** Contains the train-test of SWA, LCF and original feature for simple machine learning (e.g. RF, GBM).
4. **classic regression test:** Contains the train-test of simple machine learning.
5. **model:** Contains the all model source codes.
6. **plots:** Contains plots created for the paper.
